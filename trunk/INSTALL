How to build/install
--------------------
Once you have this source kit, you can either build using the supplied
(handmade) Makefile:
	# make
	
(The supplied Makefile is the easiest way to CROSS-build the Win32 programs,
but this will interest you only if you have MinGW installed.)
	
OR you can use the conventional GNU 'configure' method (experimental for now):
	# ./configure
	# make
and to put the program in a usual install directory:
	# make install

(This should also work for Cygwin, but is untested.)

See './configure --help' for standard GNU options, such as changing 
the program's final resting place, or compiler, or compiler options.
