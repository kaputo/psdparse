How to build/install
--------------------

1. build using the supplied Makefile:
	# make
	
The supplied Makefile is the easiest way to:
	- CROSS-build the Win32 programs, if you have MinGW installed;
	- build on OS X (unless you have already installed libpng)
See the Makefile for more information and prerequisites.
	
OR 
2. you can use the conventional GNU 'configure' method (experimental for now):
	# ./configure
	# make
and to put the program in a usual install directory:
	# make install

(This should also work for Cygwin, but is untested.)

See './configure --help' for standard GNU options, such as changing 
the program's final resting place, or compiler, or compiler options.
